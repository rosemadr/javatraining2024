public class Wrapper {
//    wrappers for primative data types e.g. Integer(). They encapsulate primative data type - they allow method access.
//    They also make it possible to have a null default e.g. for boolean
//    Some places we cannot use primative data types: e.g. in Arrays, which only allow reference types as elements
//    They are immutable
//    autoboxing and unboxing - allows easy conversion between primative and wrappers
//    object heirachy -> object is top, then the numeric types have a parent class of Number
